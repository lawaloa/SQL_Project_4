## üîó Joining Pieces Together: Finding the Data We Need Across Tables
---

At this stage of the **Maji Ndogo Water Crisis** project, I was determined to bring together all the scattered pieces of data into a single, insightful view.  

When I first started exploring the dataset, I often made the rookie mistake of merging *every* table and column into one large table before analyzing. It worked on smaller datasets, but with one this size ‚Äî performance dropped, queries lagged, and the whole process became inefficient.  

So this time, I took a step back and thought carefully about the questions I needed to answer.  
That mindset shift ‚Äî from *"get everything"* to *"get only what I need"* ‚Äî changed the game for me.

---

### üîç Questions I Wanted to Answer
---

1. Are there any specific provinces or towns where certain types of water sources are more common?  
2. We previously identified **`tap_in_home_broken`** taps as easy wins ‚Äî are there any towns where this problem is particularly bad?

To answer these, I needed data from:
- `location` ‚Üí province and town names  
- `water_source` ‚Üí type of source and number of people served  
- `visits` ‚Üí connection between sources and locations  
- `well_pollution` ‚Üí quality data for wells only  

---

### üß† My Thinking Process
---

Because `location` and `water_source` can‚Äôt be directly joined, I realized the **`visits`** table would act as the bridge between them.  
Once I understood that, building the query felt like solving a puzzle ‚Äî piece by piece.

---

### üß© Step 1: Joining `location` to `visits`
---

<details>
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
USE md_water_services;

SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id 
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id;
```

</details>


</details> <details> <summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>

| province_name | town_name | visit_count | location_id |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Sokoto        | Ilanga    | 1           | SoIl32582   |
| ...           | ...       | ...         | ...         |

</details>


### üîó Step 2: Adding `water_source`
---

Next, I joined the `water_source` table to include details about each water source.

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    s.number_of_people_served
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id
JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id;
```

</details> 

<details> 
<summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>
  
| province_name | town_name | visit_count | location_id | type_of_water_source | number_of_people_served |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00000   | tap_in_home          | 956                     |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00001   | tap_in_home_broken   | 930                     |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00002   | tap_in_home_broken   | 486                     |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00003   | well                 | 364                     |
| ...           | ...       | ...         | ...         | ...                  | ...                     |

</details>


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 3: Handling Duplicates
---

When I filtered for a specific location, I noticed something interesting ‚Äî the same `location_id` appeared multiple times with different `visit_count` values.

<details>
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    s.number_of_people_served
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id
JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.location_id = 'AkHa00103';
```

</details> 

<details> 
<summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>
  
| province_name | town_name | visit_count | location_id | type_of_water_source | number_of_people_served |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00103   | shared_tap           | 3340                    |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 2           | AkHa00103   | shared_tap           | 3340                    |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 3           | AkHa00103   | shared_tap           | 3340                    |
| ...           | ...       | ...         | ...         | ...                  | ...                     |

</details>

This duplication would inflate results during aggregation. To fix it, I filtered for `visit_count = 1`  to ensure only the first survey record was used.

### üß© Step 4: Final Join and Filtering
---

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    l.location_type,
    s.number_of_people_served,
    v.time_in_queue
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id
JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details> 

<details> 
<summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>

| province_name | town_name | type_of_water_source | location_type | number_of_people_served | time_in_queue |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Sokoto        | Ilanga    | river                | Urban         | 402                     | 15            |
| Kilimani      | Rural     | well                 | Rural         | 252                     | 0             |
| Hawassa       | Rural     | shared_tap           | Rural         | 542                     | 62            |
| Akatsi        | Lusaka    | well                 | Urban         | 210                     | 0             |
| ...           | ...       | ...                  | ...           | ...                     | ...           |

</details>

### üíß Step 5: Integrating `well_pollution`
---

For this part, I had to remind myself that `well_pollution` only contains data about wells. Using an `INNER JOIN` would exclude non-well sources, so I opted for a `LEFT JOIN` instead to retain all sources and add pollution data where available.

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    s.number_of_people_served,
    l.location_type,
    v.time_in_queue,
    w.results
FROM visits AS v
LEFT JOIN well_pollution AS w
ON v.source_id = w.source_id
INNER JOIN location AS l
ON v.location_id = l.location_id
INNER JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details>

### üèóÔ∏è Step 6: Creating a View for Reuse
---

I decided to turn the final query into a view so I could easily reuse it across other analyses and visualizations.

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
CREATE VIEW combined_analysis_table AS 
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source AS source_type,
    s.number_of_people_served AS people_served,
    l.location_type,
    v.time_in_queue,
    w.results
FROM visits AS v
LEFT JOIN well_pollution AS w
ON v.source_id = w.source_id
INNER JOIN location AS l
ON v.location_id = l.location_id
INNER JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details>

### üí≠ Reflection
---

This part of the project reminded me why I love data analysis. It‚Äôs not just about writing SQL ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **understanding relationships**, **optimizing queries**, and **making data tell a coherent story**.

Every join felt like connecting the dots in a mystery, and when the final table came together, it finally made sense.
It was a small but satisfying victory in my journey toward becoming a better data storyteller.
