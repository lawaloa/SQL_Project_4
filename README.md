## 🗣️ Message from President Aziza Naledi
---

> Dear Team,  
> I would like to thank the team for uncovering the corruption of our field workers and letting me know. As you all know, I have no tolerance for people who look after themselves first, at the cost of everyone else, so I have taken the necessary steps!  
>
> Our journey continues, as we aim to convert our data into actionable knowledge. Understanding the situation is one thing, but translating that understanding into informed decisions will truly make a difference.  
>
> As we step into this next phase, you will be shaping our raw data into meaningful views—providing essential information to decision-makers. This will enable us to discern the materials we need, plan our budgets, and identify the areas requiring immediate attention.  
>
> Remember, each step you take contributes to a larger goal—the transformation of Maji Ndogo.  
> Your diligence and dedication are instrumental in shaping a brighter future for our community.  
>
> — **President Aziza Naledi**

## 🚀 Gearing Up for the Last SQL Project
---

Hey! How have you been? I’m moving to another project soon, so this might be the last time we work together for a while.  
I thought you would appreciate this:

> It’s really good to see justice taking the front seat.  
> Maji Ndogo is changing—and it’s because President Naledi gets it.  
> She’s serious about using data and leaving no room for corruption.  
> That gives me hope. 🌍

## 🏁 Introduction: Starting the Final Journey
---

The **Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project** marks the culmination of our SQL journey—bringing together multiple datasets to uncover hidden insights about the water crisis in Maji Ndogo.  
This phase focuses on synthesizing previous analyses and presenting actionable recommendations to guide national water management strategies.

---

## 🔗 Joining Pieces Together: Finding the Data We Need Across Tables
---

In this section, we perform **SQL joins** across various tables—linking datasets on water sources, survey data, population figures, and budget allocations—to form a unified view of the situation in Maji Ndogo.  

Key SQL concepts applied:
- `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` to connect related datasets  
- Data cleaning and filtering using `WHERE`, `CASE`, and aggregate functions  
- Structuring queries for clarity and reproducibility  

---

## 📊 The Last Analysis: Finding the Final Insights from Our Data
---

Here, we move from exploration to **decision-oriented insights**:
- Identifying regions most affected by water shortages  
- Highlighting inefficiencies and corruption among field workers  
- Prioritizing interventions for equitable resource distribution  

---

## 📋 Summary Report: Sharing Our Knowledge with Decision Makers
The summarized report transforms our data into a narrative that policymakers can understand at a glance.  
Through tables, charts, and SQL summaries, we highlight:
- Regions needing urgent attention  
- Budgetary gaps and material needs  
- Recommendations for transparency and accountability  

---

## 🧭 A Practical Plan: From Analysis to Action
This final stage turns insight into **action** by developing:
- Job lists for engineers and project managers  
- Material and budget requirement sheets  
- Strategic plans for long-term water sustainability
