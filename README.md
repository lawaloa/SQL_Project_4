## üîó Joining Pieces Together: Finding the Data We Need Across Tables
---

At this stage of the **Maji Ndogo Water Crisis** project, I was determined to bring together all the scattered pieces of data into a single, insightful view.  

When I first started exploring the dataset, I often made the rookie mistake of merging *every* table and column into one large table before analyzing. It worked on smaller datasets, but with one this size ‚Äî performance dropped, queries lagged, and the whole process became inefficient.  

So this time, I took a step back and thought carefully about the questions I needed to answer.  
That mindset shift ‚Äî from *"get everything"* to *"get only what I need"* ‚Äî changed the game for me.

---

### üîç Questions I Wanted to Answer
---

1. Are there any specific provinces or towns where certain types of water sources are more common?  
2. We previously identified **`tap_in_home_broken`** taps as easy wins ‚Äî are there any towns where this problem is particularly bad?

To answer these, I needed data from:
- `location` ‚Üí province and town names  
- `water_source` ‚Üí type of source and number of people served  
- `visits` ‚Üí connection between sources and locations  
- `well_pollution` ‚Üí quality data for wells only  

---

### üß† My Thinking Process
---

Because `location` and `water_source` can‚Äôt be directly joined, I realized the **`visits`** table would act as the bridge between them.  
Once I understood that, building the query felt like solving a puzzle ‚Äî piece by piece.

---

### üß© Step 1: Joining `location` to `visits`
---

<details>
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
USE md_water_services;

SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id 
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id;
```

</details>


</details> <details> <summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>

| province_name | town_name | visit_count | location_id |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Sokoto        | Ilanga    | 1           | SoIl32582   |
| ...           | ...       | ...         | ...         |

</details>


### üîó Step 2: Adding `water_source`
---

Next, I joined the `water_source` table to include details about each water source.

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    s.number_of_people_served
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id
JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id;
```

</details> 

<details> 
<summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>
  
| province_name | town_name | visit_count | location_id | type_of_water_source | number_of_people_served |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00000   | tap_in_home          | 956                     |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00001   | tap_in_home_broken   | 930                     |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00002   | tap_in_home_broken   | 486                     |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00003   | well                 | 364                     |
| ...           | ...       | ...         | ...         | ...                  | ...                     |

</details>


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 3: Handling Duplicates
---

When I filtered for a specific location, I noticed something interesting ‚Äî the same `location_id` appeared multiple times with different `visit_count` values.

<details>
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    s.number_of_people_served
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id
JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.location_id = 'AkHa00103';
```

</details> 

<details> 
<summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>
  
| province_name | town_name | visit_count | location_id | type_of_water_source | number_of_people_served |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 1           | AkHa00103   | shared_tap           | 3340                    |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 2           | AkHa00103   | shared_tap           | 3340                    |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 3           | AkHa00103   | shared_tap           | 3340                    |
| ...           | ...       | ...         | ...         | ...                  | ...                     |

</details>

This duplication would inflate results during aggregation. To fix it, I filtered for `visit_count = 1`  to ensure only the first survey record was used.

### üß© Step 4: Final Join and Filtering
---

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    l.location_type,
    s.number_of_people_served,
    v.time_in_queue
FROM location AS l
JOIN visits AS v
ON l.location_id = v.location_id
JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details> 

<details> 
<summary>üìä Click to view result table</summary>

| province_name | town_name | type_of_water_source | location_type | number_of_people_served | time_in_queue |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Sokoto        | Ilanga    | river                | Urban         | 402                     | 15            |
| Kilimani      | Rural     | well                 | Rural         | 252                     | 0             |
| Hawassa       | Rural     | shared_tap           | Rural         | 542                     | 62            |
| Akatsi        | Lusaka    | well                 | Urban         | 210                     | 0             |
| ...           | ...       | ...                  | ...           | ...                     | ...           |

</details>

### üíß Step 5: Integrating `well_pollution`
---

For this part, I had to remind myself that `well_pollution` only contains data about wells. Using an `INNER JOIN` would exclude non-well sources, so I opted for a `LEFT JOIN` instead to retain all sources and add pollution data where available.

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    s.number_of_people_served,
    l.location_type,
    v.time_in_queue,
    w.results
FROM visits AS v
LEFT JOIN well_pollution AS w
ON v.source_id = w.source_id
INNER JOIN location AS l
ON v.location_id = l.location_id
INNER JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details>

### üèóÔ∏è Step 6: Creating a View for Reuse
---

I decided to turn the final query into a view so I could easily reuse it across other analyses and visualizations.

<details> 
<summary>üßæ Click to view SQL Query</summary>

```sql
CREATE VIEW combined_analysis_table AS 
SELECT
	l.province_name,
    l.town_name,
    v.visit_count,
    v.location_id,
    s.type_of_water_source AS source_type,
    s.number_of_people_served AS people_served,
    l.location_type,
    v.time_in_queue,
    w.results
FROM visits AS v
LEFT JOIN well_pollution AS w
ON v.source_id = w.source_id
INNER JOIN location AS l
ON v.location_id = l.location_id
INNER JOIN water_source AS s
ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details>

### üí≠ Reflection
---

This part of the project reminded me why I love data analysis. It‚Äôs not just about writing SQL ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **understanding relationships**, **optimizing queries**, and **making data tell a coherent story**.

Every join felt like connecting the dots in a mystery, and when the final table came together, it finally made sense.
It was a small but satisfying victory in my journey toward becoming a better data storyteller.

---


## üìä The Last Analysis: Finding the Final Insights from Our Data
---

his part of the project felt different for me ‚Äî more personal.
I wasn‚Äôt just querying data anymore; I was uncovering stories hidden in the numbers. Every percentage, every row, was a reflection of real people‚Äôs lives.

So, I decided to take a closer look ‚Äî province by province, and then town by town ‚Äî to understand who had access to clean water and who didn‚Äôt.

### üíß Provincial Overview ‚Äî Spotting the Big Picture
---

Before jumping into towns, I wanted to see the broader picture across provinces.
Here‚Äôs the query I wrote to aggregate the data.

<details> 
<summary>üë©‚Äçüíª <b>Click to view my SQL Query</b></summary>

```sql
WITH province_totals AS ( -- This CTE calculates the population of each province
    SELECT
        province_name,
        SUM(people_served) AS total_ppl_serv
    FROM
        combined_analysis_table
    GROUP BY
        province_name
)
SELECT
    ct.province_name,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'river' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / pt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS river,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'shared_tap' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / pt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS shared_tap,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'tap_in_home' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / pt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS tap_in_home,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'tap_in_home_broken' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / pt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS tap_in_home_broken,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'well' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / pt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS well
FROM
    combined_analysis_table ct
JOIN
    province_totals pt ON ct.province_name = pt.province_name
GROUP BY
    ct.province_name
ORDER BY
    ct.province_name;
```

</details> 

<details> 
<summary>üìä <b>Click to view provincial result table</b></summary>

| province_name | river     | shared_tap  | tap_in_home | tap_in_home_broken | well |
| ------------- |-----------| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| Sokoto        | 45        | 18          | 25          | 9                  | 3    |
| Amanzi        | 3         | 28          | 48          | 21                 | 0    |
| Akatsi        | 7         | 15          | 30          | 32                 | 16   |

</details>

### üìà Visualizing the Provincial Pattern
---

Here‚Äôs what the data looks like when visualized ‚Äî clearer, more emotional, and more powerful.

![Population Percentage by Source of Water, per Province](https://github.com/lawaloa/SQL_Project_4/blob/main/Pattern_image.png)

> üß© This graph confirmed what I saw in the query ‚Äî **Sokoto** stands out with a very high percentage of people depending on river water.
> **Amanzi**, on the other hand, shows a worrying number of broken taps.
> These patterns helped me prioritize where to send repair teams first.


### üèò Town-Level Insights ‚Äî Getting Personal
---

Next, I zoomed in further. But it wasn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî I realized that some town names repeat (like Harare in both Akatsi and Kilimani).
So I grouped my data by both province and town, to get the right picture.

<details> 
<summary>üë©‚Äçüíª <b>Click to view my Town Aggregation Query</b></summary>

```sql
WITH town_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        province_name, 
        town_name, 
        SUM(people_served) AS total_ppl_serv
    FROM 
        combined_analysis_table
    GROUP BY 
        province_name, town_name
)
SELECT
    ct.province_name,
    ct.town_name,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'river' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / tt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS river,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'shared_tap' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / tt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS shared_tap,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'tap_in_home' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / tt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS tap_in_home,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'tap_in_home_broken' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / tt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS tap_in_home_broken,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN source_type = 'well' THEN people_served ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / tt.total_ppl_serv), 0) AS well
FROM
    combined_analysis_table AS ct
JOIN
    town_totals AS tt 
    ON ct.province_name = tt.province_name 
    AND ct.town_name = tt.town_name
GROUP BY
    ct.province_name, ct.town_name
ORDER BY
    ct.town_name;
```

</details> 

<details>
<summary>üìä <b>Click to view sample Town Result Table</b></summary>

| province_name | town_name   | tap_in_home | tap_in_home_broken | shared_Tap | well | river |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ---- | ----- |
| Akatsi        | Harare      | 28          | 27                 | 17         | 27   | 2     |
| Amanzi        | Amina       | 3           | 56                 | 24         | 9    | 8     |
| Amanzi        | Dahabu      | 55          | 1                  | 37         | 4    | 3     |

</details>

While reading through these results, one town stood out ‚Äî **Amina** in Amanzi.
Only 3% of its people have running water, yet more than half have taps installed that don‚Äôt work.

That hit me.
I wrote in my notes:

> ‚ÄúIf I could deploy one repair team today, I‚Äôd send them to Amina first.‚Äù

### üßæ Finding Patterns ‚Äî Telling Data Stories
---

I also calculated which towns had the highest share of **broken taps** relative to total installed taps:

<details> 
<summary>üë©‚Äçüíª <b>Click to view Query</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT
    province_name,
    town_name,
    ROUND(tap_in_home_broken / (tap_in_home_broken + tap_in_home) * 100, 0) AS Pct_broken_taps
FROM
    town_aggregated_water_access;
```

</details> 

<details>
<summary>üìä <b>Click to view Result Table</b></summary>

| province_name | town_name  | Pct_broken_taps |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Amanzi        | Amina      | 95              |
| Amanzi        | Bello      | 52              |
| Akatsi        | Kintampo   | 46              |


</details>

Amina again. Almost all taps broken.
It was clear now ‚Äî this wasn‚Äôt just data; it was evidence.
I could visualize the inequality: Dahabu (the capital, where past politicians lived) had perfectly working taps, while surrounding towns struggled to find clean water.

This realization shaped my final summary and recommendations.

### üí≠ My Takeaway
---

This part of the project reminded me why I love data.
It‚Äôs not just about numbers and queries ‚Äî it‚Äôs about using data to *see people, spot injustice, and propose solutions that matter*.

Every `CTE`, every `JOIN`, every percentage ‚Äî they all told a story.
And now, I was ready to turn those insights into action.

---

## üìã Summary Report: Sharing Our Knowledge with Decision Makers
--- 

### üí° Insights  

Alright, let‚Äôs wrap up what I‚Äôve discovered from this project.  
A few weeks ago, I dug into the data, and here‚Äôs what stood out to me:  

1. Most of **Maji Ndogo‚Äôs** water sources are rural.  
2. About **43% of our people rely on shared taps** ‚Äî sometimes as many as **2,000 people per tap**.  
3. Around **31% of households** have water infrastructure at home, but within that group,  
4. Nearly **45% face non-functional systems** ‚Äî mostly due to faulty **pipes, pumps, and reservoirs**.  
   - Towns like **Amina**, rural **Amanzi**, and parts of **Akatsi** and **Hawassa** are among the worst hit.  
5. About **18% of the population use wells**, but only **28% of those wells are clean** ‚Äî especially in **Hawassa**, **Kilimani**, and **Akatsi**.  
6. Water access also comes with long waits ‚Äî often **over 120 minutes** on average:  
   - Queues stretch the longest on **Saturdays**.  
   - They peak in the **mornings and evenings**.  
   - **Wednesdays and Sundays** tend to be the easiest days to fetch water.  

Seeing all this laid out made me realize just how much everyday life in Maji Ndogo depends on a few key sources ‚Äî and how much impact a small fix can make.  

---

### üß© Plan of Action  

Based on the data, here‚Äôs the approach I‚Äôd take moving forward:  

1. **Tackle shared taps first** ‚Äî improving them will help the largest number of people immediately.  
2. **Clean up wells** ‚Äî they‚Äôre a good source, but contamination is widespread.  
3. **Repair broken infrastructure** ‚Äî one fix here can benefit hundreds of homes and reduce queuing elsewhere.  
4. **Hold off on new home installations (for now)** ‚Äî focusing resources where they‚Äôll have the biggest impact.  
5. **Prepare rural teams** ‚Äî most work will happen outside urban centers, where logistics and access are tougher.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Solutions  

1. **Rivers:** For communities still depending on rivers, I‚Äôd start by sending water trucks as a short-term solution while we drill wells for a permanent fix. **Sokoto** would be my first target.  
2. **Wells:** I‚Äôd install filters ‚Äî **RO (Reverse Osmosis) filters** for chemical pollution and **Ultra Violent (UV) filters** for biological contamination. Long-term, I‚Äôd investigate the root causes of these pollutants.  
3. **Shared taps:**  
   - In the short term, send **extra tankers** to the busiest taps on the busiest days (guided by the queue-time data).  
   - In the medium term, **install additional taps** where demand is highest ‚Äî starting with **Bello**, **Abidjan**, and **Zuri**.  
   - The goal: bring average queue times **below 30 minutes**, following **UN standards**.  
4. **Low-queue taps:** Taps with short wait times (<30 min) don‚Äôt need immediate upgrades ‚Äî installing home taps here will be a longer-term goal.  
5. **Broken infrastructure:** Repairing one reservoir or major pipe can restore access for hundreds. I‚Äôd prioritize **Amina**, **Lusaka**, **Zuri**, **Djenne**, and the rural parts of **Amanzi**.  

---

I‚Äôve really enjoyed diving deep into this project ‚Äî it‚Äôs been more than just SQL queries and dashboards; it‚Äôs about understanding how **data can tell human stories**.  
Every row and column pointed back to real people waiting in real queues ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what keeps me motivated to keep building, one dataset at a time. üíßüìä

## üß≠ A Practical Plan: From Analysis to Action
---

Now that I‚Äôve wrapped up my analysis, it‚Äôs time to **put the plan into action** ‚Äî right inside the database.

I‚Äôve come a long way with this project, and this part feels like the most meaningful one.  
It‚Äôs where all the insights, numbers, and logic finally become **real, trackable steps** that can help our engineers improve water access across **Maji Ndogo**.  

The goal is simple:  
I want to build a table that gives our field teams everything they need ‚Äî **where to go, what to fix, and how to report back**.  

They‚Äôll need:
- The **address** of each location (street, town, province).  
- The **type of water source**.  
- The **specific action** needed (repair, upgrade, or replacement).  
- Space to **update progress** and record **completion dates**.  

So, I created a table called **`Project_progress`**.  

---

<details>
<summary>üß± <b>Click to view the CREATE TABLE query</b></summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE Project_progress (
    Project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL REFERENCES water_source(source_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    Address VARCHAR(50),
    Town VARCHAR(30),
    Province VARCHAR(30),
    Source_type VARCHAR(50),
    Improvement VARCHAR(50),
    Source_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Backlog' CHECK (Source_status IN ('Backlog', 'In progress', 'Complete')),
    Date_of_completion DATE,
    Comments TEXT
);
```

</details> 

Once the structure is ready, I moved on to design the query that actually fills this table ‚Äî using everything I‚Äôve learned so far.


### üß† My Thought Process
---

The diagram below illustrates the logical flow of my query construction and data-filtering steps:
  
![](https://github.com/lawaloa/SQL_Project_4/blob/main/Flow_chart.png)

At a high level, my improvement logic looks like this:

1. **Rivers** ‚Üí Drill wells.

2. **Wells**:
   - If chemically contaminated ‚Üí Install **RO filter**.
   - If biologically contaminated ‚Üí **Install UV + RO filters**.

3. **Shared taps**:
   - If queue time ‚â• 30 minutes ‚Üí Install **X extra taps**, where `X = FLOOR(time_in_queue / 30)`.

4. **In-home taps (broken)**: Diagnose local infrastructure.

The logic felt like a perfect use case for `CASE statements` ‚Äî my favourite SQL control flow tool.

### üß© Combining the Data
---

To make this work, I joined together the `water_source`, `well_pollution`, `visits`, and `location` tables.
Then I filtered out any data that wasn‚Äôt relevant ‚Äî keeping only the first visit to each site and the sources that actually need improvement.

Here‚Äôs the initial query logic:

<details> 
<summary>ü™Ñ <b>Click to view the filtering query</b></summary>

```sql

SELECT
    l.address,
    l.town_name,
    l.province_name,
    s.source_id,
    s.type_of_water_source,
    w.results
FROM
    water_source AS s
LEFT JOIN
    well_pollution AS w ON s.source_id = w.source_id
INNER JOIN
    visits AS v ON s.source_id = v.source_id
INNER JOIN
    location AS l ON l.location_id = v.location_id
WHERE
    v.visit_count = 1
    AND (
        w.results != 'Clean'
        OR s.type_of_water_source IN ('tap_in_home_broken', 'river')
        OR (s.type_of_water_source = 'shared_tap' AND v.time_in_queue > 30)
    );
```

</details>

### üß© Final Query
---

After layering in all the logic with `CASE` statements, here‚Äôs the final query that generates the data for `Project_progress`.

<details> 
<summary>üìä <b>Click to view the final query</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT
    s.source_id,
    l.address,
    l.town_name,
    l.province_name,
    s.type_of_water_source AS source_type,

    CASE
        WHEN w.results = 'Contaminated: Chemical' THEN 'Install RO filter'
        WHEN w.results = 'Contaminated: Biological' THEN 'Install UV filter'
        WHEN s.type_of_water_source = 'river' THEN 'Drill well'
        WHEN s.type_of_water_source = 'shared_tap' AND v.time_in_queue > 30
            THEN CONCAT('Install ', FLOOR(v.time_in_queue / 30), ' taps nearby')
        WHEN s.type_of_water_source = 'tap_in_home_broken' THEN 'Diagnose local infrastructure'
        ELSE NULL
    END AS Improvement,

    CASE
        WHEN w.results IN ('Contaminated: Chemical', 'Contaminated: Biological')
            OR s.type_of_water_source = 'river'
            OR (s.type_of_water_source = 'shared_tap' AND v.time_in_queue > 30)
            OR s.type_of_water_source = 'tap_in_home_broken'
        THEN 'In progress'
        ELSE 'Backlog'
    END AS Source_status,

    NULL AS Date_of_completion,
    NULL AS Comments

FROM
    water_source AS s
LEFT JOIN
    well_pollution AS w ON s.source_id = w.source_id
INNER JOIN
    visits AS v ON s.source_id = v.source_id
INNER JOIN
    location AS l ON l.location_id = v.location_id

WHERE
    v.visit_count = 1
    AND (
        w.results != 'Clean'
        OR s.type_of_water_source IN ('tap_in_home_broken', 'river')
        OR (s.type_of_water_source = 'shared_tap' AND v.time_in_queue > 30)
    );
```

</details>

### üì• Inserting the Results into the Table
---

After verifying the query results (about **25,398 rows**), I inserted them directly into the new table.

<details> 
<summary>üóÇÔ∏è <b>Click to view the INSERT query</b></summary>

```sql
INSERT INTO Project_progress (
    source_id,
    Address,
    Town,
    Province,
    Source_type,
    Improvement,
    Source_status,
    Date_of_completion,
    Comments
)
SELECT
    s.source_id,
    l.address,
    l.town_name,
    l.province_name,
    s.type_of_water_source AS source_type,

    CASE
        WHEN w.results = 'Contaminated: Chemical' THEN 'Install RO filter'
        WHEN w.results = 'Contaminated: Biological' THEN 'Install UV filter'
        WHEN s.type_of_water_source = 'river' THEN 'Drill well'
        WHEN s.type_of_water_source = 'shared_tap' AND v.time_in_queue > 30
            THEN CONCAT('Install ', FLOOR(v.time_in_queue / 30), ' taps nearby')
        WHEN s.type_of_water_source = 'tap_in_home_broken' THEN 'Diagnose local infrastructure'
        ELSE NULL
    END AS Improvement,

    CASE
        WHEN w.results IN ('Contaminated: Chemical', 'Contaminated: Biological')
            OR s.type_of_water_source = 'river'
            OR (s.type_of_water_source = 'shared_tap' AND v.time_in_queue > 30)
            OR s.type_of_water_source = 'tap_in_home_broken'
        THEN 'In progress'
        ELSE 'Backlog'
    END AS Source_status,

    NULL AS Date_of_completion,
    NULL AS Comments

FROM
    water_source AS s
LEFT JOIN
    well_pollution AS w ON s.source_id = w.source_id
INNER JOIN
    visits AS v ON s.source_id = v.source_id
INNER JOIN
    location AS l ON l.location_id = v.location_id

WHERE
    v.visit_count = 1
    AND (
        w.results != 'Clean'
        OR s.type_of_water_source IN ('tap_in_home_broken', 'river')
        OR (s.type_of_water_source = 'shared_tap' AND v.time_in_queue > 30)
    );
```

</details>

### ü™∂ Wrapping Up
---

And that‚Äôs it ‚Äî my `Project_progress` table is ready to guide the repair teams!
It will let us track repairs, upgrades, and completions ‚Äî and give President Naledi a clear picture of progress as it happens.

This was a long journey ‚Äî from **joins** to **window** functions, and even a few debugging marathons.
But looking back, I can honestly say I‚Äôve learned how to **think in SQL**, not just write it.
